          <h1>The Waterfall Model</h1>
          <p>Unlike Agile, the Waterfall model is sequential with each phase representing a distinct stage of software development. Generally, each phase finishes before the next phase can commence.
            Importantly, the testing phase in Waterfall only starts after the implementation of the system is done.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Waterfall model is a sequential process where the development is divided into phases. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin, without the possibility for overlapping phases.
              In the Waterfall model, the result of one phase impacts the next, meaning that the next phase can only commence when the previous phase is complete. The name Waterfall derives from the design of the model, a
              steady flowing process resembling a waterfall.</p>
              <p>The Waterfall model is a linear approach, in that it moves from one phase to another without revisiting previous phases. Phases cannot be veered from either, so think of the Waterfall model as building a house.
                You start at the bottom by laying the foundations and work your way through each phase until finally, you are putting on the roof. Importantly, you cannot decide to change the foundation of the house (project) when the
                roof is being put on. Returning to a previous phase would require an overhaul of the entire house (project), not just the foundations.</p>

              <li><b>System Design:</b> The requirements obtained in phase 1 are studied allowing for decisions to be made relating to specifying hardware choices, programming languages, database design and other technical details.</li>
              <li><b>Implementation:</b> The product is built using the input from the previous phase.</li>
              <li><b>Testing:</b> The product is tested to verify the requirements and specification of the client is being met.</li>
