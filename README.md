iiT - An Introduction into Testing

## Background
Research in speech recognition technology has been undertaken for over sixty years with the topic being predominantly focussing on three areas: its history, advancements and limitations. Despite its limitations, the concept and acceptance towards using speech have grown exponentially over the last ten years, primarily due to the emergence of speech recognition as an Artificial Intelligence. One category of AI has witnessed substantial growth, voice assistants (Milhorat et al., 2014) and described by (Kumar et al., 2015) as a dynamic system possessing the ability to learn the userâ€™s preference. 

Between 2015 and 2021, the use of voice assistants is expected to grow from 390 million to 1.8 billion users, with annual revenue expected to grow from $1.6 billion to $15.8 billion (Tractica, 2016). While digital assistants are artificial intelligence, a technology beyond the scope of this project, their popularity suggests that users are more than comfortable interacting with a device by using speech. 
While the success of speech recognition as an AI does not represent the population of speech recognition, it highlights the emergence of user acceptance towards using speech technology. The concept of interacting by using speech is rapidly being embraced by consumers (Goksel and Mutlu, 2016).

Speech recognition has advanced immeasurably over the last six decades and will continue to evolve. Research has shown that despite its increasing consumer popularity, and users continuing to challenge the status quo by migrating away from the generic solutions, previous research on speech recognition can be categorised into its history, and its shortcomings. An evident and distinct pattern is evident, highlighting a significant gap in the literature. 

Interestingly, and perhaps surprising to some, over half of the world's population is connected to the internet. Over half of the world's population are actively interacting with websites daily. That is an incredible statistic in comparison to the percentage of the population that do not have running water. Which begs the question, can a website and speech recognition be combined? After extensive research and reviewing vast amounts of literature, it can confidentially be said that there is a substantial relatable gap in research and technology. Thus, the present study aims to establish the feasibility of user navigation around a website using speech commands.

## iiT

iiT was created to provide Edge Hill students with a platform to discover the foundations of software testing. The concept of the website is to be informative first. Thus, allowing for a platform that serves two purposes: First, to bridge the gap between course material and a foundation of prior knowledge. Secondly, iiT is a tool to test the overarching aim of my final year project, to establish the feasibility of controlling a website using speech.
